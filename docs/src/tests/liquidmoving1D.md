# 1D Stefan Problem

This example demonstrates how to solve a one‑phase Stefan problem where the interface position is computed via a Newton-based scheme (non‑prescribed motion). The problem is formulated as a moving liquid diffusion problem.

## Problem Setup

- **Mesh:** A 1D mesh with `nx` cells is defined on the domain `[0, lx]`.
- **Body:** The body is defined via a signed distance function with the initial interface located at `xf`.
- **Space‑Time Mesh:** A space‑time mesh is built with a time step Δt.
- **Capacity & Operator:** The capacity (geometry) and the diffusion operator are computed based on the moving domain.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Dirichlet conditions are imposed on the top and bottom boundaries.
- **Interface (Stefan) Conditions:** The flux jump is computed with parameters ρ and L. Newton parameters (max_iter and tol) are set to control convergence while computing the new interface position.
- **Solver:** The `MovingLiquidDiffusionUnsteadyMono` solver is used with a backward Euler scheme for stability.
- **Post‑Processing:** The script plots the Newton residuals over the iterations, the evolution of the interface position (xf_log), and the final temperature distribution.

## Governing Equations

The unsteady diffusion equation inside a moving domain is solved:
  
  ∂u/∂t = ∇·(D∇u) + f
  
with an interface condition based on a Stefan condition. The interface is not prescribed a priori; rather, its position is computed via a Newton loop aiming to balance the change in volume with the computed flux jump:
  
  Hₙ₊₁ − Hₙ − (1/(ρL))·Flux = 0
  
where H denotes the sum of the capacity (volumes) in the current and previous time levels.
