# Mesh Usage

This page explains how to construct a `Mesh` in **Penguin.jl** when you specify the number of cells along each dimension, the overall domain lengths, and the origin coordinates. This form of initialization automatically computes the cell centers, nodes.

## Defining a Mesh with Counts and Domain Dimensions

Consider a 2D mesh defined as follows:

```julia
using Penguin

# Define the mesh parameters
nx, ny = 5, 5         # Number of cells in x and y directions
lx, ly = 4.0, 4.0     # Total domain lengths in x and y
x0, y0 = 0.0, 0.0     # Origin (starting coordinates)

# Create the mesh
mesh = Mesh((nx, ny), (lx, ly), (x0, y0))
```

In this setup:
- **nx, ny**: Specify the resolution (number of cells) along each axis.
- **lx, ly**: Define the overall lengths of the domain in the x and y directions.
- **x0, y0**: Set the starting coordinate for the mesh, which is useful for offsetting the grid.

## How It Works

Using this constructor, `Penguin.jl` automatically performs the following:
1. **Nodes**: Computes the boundaries of each cell.
2. **Centers**: Determines the position of each cell center.
3. **Tagging**: Adds metadata (such as border cell indices) to help identify cells at the domain boundaries.

## Viewing Mesh Properties

After creating your mesh, you can explore its properties:

```julia
# Print the computed centers and number of cells
println("Cell centers: ", mesh.centers)
println("Total number of cells: ", nC(mesh))
```

You can also retrieve border cells, which are defined as those at the edges of the domain:

```julia
borders = get_border_cells(mesh)
println("Number of border cells: ", length(borders))
```

## Summary

By defining a mesh with cell counts and domain dimensions as shown:
- You easily construct and configure the grid.
- The `Mesh` constructor automatically generates necessary geometric data.
- You’re equipped to further use the mesh in simulations or data analysis.

This approach is especially useful when you want a quick setup using a uniform grid without manually precomputing coordinate vectors.  

## Defining a Space–Time Mesh

Besides a purely spatial mesh, *Penguin.jl* also provides a `SpaceTimeMesh` that incorporates time as an additional dimension. This is particularly useful when your domain changes in time, such as when boundaries move according to a prescribed interface function. For instance:

```julia
# Define the spatial mesh
nx = 40
lx = 1.0
x0 = 0.0
domain = ((x0, lx),)
mesh = Penguin.Mesh((nx,), (lx,), (x0,))

# Define a moving boundary (body) as a function of x and t
xf = 0.01 * lx
c = 1.0
body = (x, t, _=0) -> (x - xf - c * sqrt(t))

# Define the Space-Time mesh
Δt   = 0.01
Tend = 0.1
STmesh = Penguin.SpaceTimeMesh(mesh, [0.0, Δt])
```

Here, the `body` function captures how the interface changes over time, and `SpaceTimeMesh` is rebuilt at each time interval `Δt` to track this motion. This approach makes it straightforward to handle time‐evolving geometries within your simulations.
