## Introduction and Quickstart

Julia Implementation of Cut-Cell method for (now) :
- Scalar Elliptic Problems
- Scalar Parabolic Problems
- Scalar Advection-Diffusion-Reaction Problems
- Solid Moving Boundaries
- Monophasic or Diphasic Problems
- Darcy Flow Solver
- Non-prescribed Interface motion (1D, 2D)
- Fully-Coupled Stokes (mono) Solver

Under development :
- Non-prescribed Interface motion in 3D
- Interface Tracking : VOF, LS, FT
- Fully Coupled Navier-Stokes Solver
- Streamfunctionâ€“vorticity solver
- Preconditionning
